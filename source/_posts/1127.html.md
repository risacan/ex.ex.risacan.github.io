# What is __unity1week__ ?
[Unity 1 week](https://unityroom.com/unity1weeks) is an one-week game jam. The theme comes out at Monday and you finish creating at Sunday at 20:00. Upload the game on the web with WebGL.

# Space
"Space" is the theme for 11/13 ~ 11/19.

# My Idea
This is my first time to join Unity 1 week so I decided to start with something I am familiar with, which is 2D.

# Write down the idea
