# What I did
* Change the color of the target rectangle.
* Draw some dogs.
* Replace rectangles to those images.

I was thinking about adding START/FINISH feature but decided to add images to keep myself motivated. And it worked! HOW CUTE THEY ARE! I forgot to draw spacesuits for the dog at the window ( which is my first original character in childhood ) but I don't care. It's cute.

# Drawing tools
* :notebook_with_decorative_cover: & :pen: 
* [Scannable \| Evernote](https://evernote.com/intl/jp/products/scannable)
* Preview on Mac :computer: 

I just drew dogs on paper with Muji pen, scanned with Scannable, sent the image to Mac, edited with Preview and dragged the image into Unity.
